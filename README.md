# RNAseqNet

Infer log-linear Poisson Graphical Model with an auxiliary dataset. Hot-deck
multiple imputation method is used to improve the reliability of the inference
ith an auxiliary dataset. Standard log-linear Poisson GM can also be used for 
the inference and the StARS criterion is implemented to drive the selection of
the regularization parameter.
